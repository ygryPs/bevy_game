# bevy_game

A 2D platformer with mechanics based on physics.

The player is a circle with an off-center mass connected to the center with a motor. The player can control the motor's torque (allows sideways movement) and the circle's radius (allows jump and angular momentum tricks).

So far, the features described are not all implemented.
